This directory contains properties files for global-scope (all applications,
servers and server groups inherit these properties).

Files that you can put here:
 * global.properties - properties defined here are used for pre-processing the
                       application archive before deploying or updating (global-scope)
 * global.liverebel_daemon.properties - LiveRebel agent daemon settings (global-scope)
